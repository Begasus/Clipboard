.SS DESCRIPTION
.PP
\f[B]clipboard\f[R] lets you cut, copy, and paste files and piped data
in the terminal.
It lacks dependencies on any GUI clipboard system, although they can be
enabled if you want.
If available, you can substitute \f[B]cb\f[R] for \f[B]clipboard\f[R] as
a shortcut.
.PP
Input a number into \f[B](id)\f[R] to select which clipboard you want to
use.
.SS FILES
.PP
\f[B]clipboard\f[R] stores its temporary data in the \f[B]Clipboard\f[R]
subdirectory in a system-provided temporary folder or in the
\f[B].clipboard\f[R] subdirectory in the user\[cq]s home folder.
There may be a symlink \f[B]cb\f[R] in the same directory where you
installed \f[B]clipboard\f[R].
