# Introducing your new second brain

The Clipboard Project (or just CB for short) is the advanced, yet <i>oh-so-easy-to-use</i> clipboard manager for anyone.

We've made it to save you precious time and effort so that you won't have to spend so much at the computer.

# Easy to use

Anyone can use CB - no matter who you are or what you're working on, from web developers to your Average Joe and even to your grandma!

Nothing dares lay more than a few button presses away.

# Packed with features

We've packed, crammed, and <i>jammed</i> CB full of useful features to increase your productivity in the most effective way possible.

You can make infinitely different clipboards as you wish, manipulate them with full-fat regex, instantly script them all, and way more.

# Tastefully stylish

Ever wondered if you could get diabetes from too much eye candy?

Well, that's a question we're still figuring out how to solve. But in the meantime, know that CB is filled with just enough eye candy to be gorgeous - and not put you into a sugar coma.

# Fast and lightweight

When you install CB, it won't take up gigabytes of your precious storage space storing useless junk, unlike some other apps out there.

And, dare we say it, it's also <i>blazingly fast</i> thanks to our use of the latest and greatest code compiling technologies.

# Open and secure

You can feast your eyes on <i>everything</i> that makes up and defines the Clipboard Project, right now, all for zero cost.

There's nothing that invades your privacy here!

# Ready to turbocharge your productivity?

Download the latest version from the [official Clipboard Project GitHub page](https://github.com/Slackadays/Clipboard/blob/main/README.md#-1), and then you'll be off to the races!

Here's what to try next.

Let's start by copying a file called "Foobar."

```sh
$ cb copy Foobar
```

Not bad, right!

Let's kick it up a notch.

```sh
$ CLIPBOARD_THEME=green CLIPBOARD_NOEMOJI=1 cb -fc -nc -np cp_500 *.txt *.png
```

Ok, so maybe we kicked it up too many notches. But it gets the point across - although CB is super easy to use, you can do a whole lot, and me mean <i>a whole lot</i>, with it.
