Answer these questions so that we can help you faster:
- [ ] If I compiled Clipboard myself, then the errors don't mention "LTO error" (this is a bug with the compiler, not Clipboard)
- [ ] If I compiled Clipboard myself, then the errors don't mention "XYZ has not been defined in namespace std" (this usually means you need a compiler with C++20 support, so upgrade first)
- [ ] I check these boxes without reading them (checking this one will make your bug report invalid!)
- [ ] I am using the latest commit/release (we only support the latest)
- [ ] If I downloaded Clipboard from GitHub Actions or with the install script, then the errors don't mention "GLIBC XYZ not found" (your system is too outdated for Clipboard, so upgrade it)
