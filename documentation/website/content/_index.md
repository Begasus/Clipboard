# What is Clipboard?

:sparkles: :rocket: Clipboard is the power tool that saves you time and effort. :beach_umbrella: :palm_tree:

Before Clipboard, you've always had to think about where exactly you want to move things in the terminal, which multiplied your mental workload and made many scenarios totally impractical. Yuck, ugh, and puke!

Clipboard changes all of this.

With Clipboard, do anything that involves moving information around way quicker and much simpler. Save time and effort the easy way.

# Getting started

Visit the [official Github repository](https://github.com/Slackadays/Clipboard) to install the latest Clipboard version.

After that, set optional environment variables if you wish to configure certain features.

Done! You can now start using Clipboard. It's that easy.
