# What is Clipboard?

The Clipboard project is a <i>ridiculously</i> easy-to-use data management tool with tons of useful features and <i>gorgeous</i> eye candy.

Before Clipboard, you've always had to think about where exactly you want to move things in the terminal, which multiplied your mental workload and made many scenarios totally impractical. 

Fear no more.

Now, do anything that involves moving information around <i>way quicker</i> and much simpler. Clipboard is your time and effort saver to use anytime and anywhere.

# Quick Start

Visit the [official Clipboard GitHub page](https://github.com/Slackadays/Clipboard) to install the latest version.

Once you've installed Clipboard, all that's left to do is to start saving time and effort by using it. Try some of these examples below!

```sh
$ cb copy NuclearLaunchCodes.pdf
$ cb note "Keep this a secret"
$ echo "Keep this a secret OR ELSE" | cb note
$ cb paste

$ cb cut69 MyDirectory
$ cb add69 SomeFile
$ cb remove69 SomeFile
$ cb paste69

$ cb cp_420 foo.bar NotAVirus.bar.mp3.exe
$ cb remove_420 "*.mp3\.exe"
$ cb note_420 "Some kosher content here"
$ cb sh_420

$ cb note
$ cb clr
$ cb note_420
$ cb
```

Of course, this is only a handful of examples. Check out [the readme on GitHub](https://github.com/Slackadays/Clipboard) again for more detailed instructions and some great tips and tricks.
