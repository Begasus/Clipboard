:tropical_drink::turtle: Make your life easier with Clipboard. üèñÔ∏èüå¥
</h1>

Our mission is to make your life easier and more productive by saving you time and effort.

Before, you've always had to think about where exactly you want to move things, which multiplied your mental workload and made many scenarios totally impractical. 

Now, have a real _power tool_ to use **anywhere in the terminal** to cut, copy, and paste things with, just like a GUI!

You can also download Clipboard [directly from GitHub Actions.](https://nightly.link/Slackadays/Clipboard/workflows/main/main)

### Install Manually (you'll need CMake and C++20 support)
Get the latest release instead by adding `--branch 0.4.0` right after `git clone...`.
Change the system installation prefix by adding `-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/custom/prefix` to `cmake ..`.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Slackadays/Clipboard 
cd Clipboard/build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=MinSizeRel ..
cmake --build .
cmake --install .
```

### Uninstall

Remove all the files in `install_manifest.txt`. If you're not using Windows, you can also do `xargs rm < install_manifest.txt`.

![How To Use](documentation/readme-assets/CBHowToUse.png)

You can substitute `cb` for `clipboard` in all commands. Add a number to the end of the action to choose which clipboard you want to use (the default is 0), or `_` to use a persistent clipboard. 

### Examples

```
clipboard copy contacts/JohnSmith NuclearLaunchCodes.pdf
clipboard cut69 MyDirectory

cb show420
cb add69 SomeFile
clipboard clr
